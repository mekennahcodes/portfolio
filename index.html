     <hr>
			<p>I'm currently studying Software Engineering at Thinkful and loving it! I live in Houston, TX and I'm from Anchorage, Alaska. Other than learning to code, here are a few things I <b>really</b> love: 
      <ul>
      <li> Cooking </li>
      <li> Hiking</li>
      <li> Photography </li>
      <li> My dog, Bruno</li>
      </ul>     
      </p>     
      
 
      <i> <h3> About Me:</h3> </i>

      <p> 
      I'm really loving all that I'm learning as a new Software Engineer at <b>Thinkful</b>. Learning how to code has been challenging and so rewarding. I can't wait to hone my craft more to solve problems and create helpful websites and even applications. I can't wait to continue to learn and start collaborating on projects with others on platforms like Github!
        </p>
       <p> 
      When I'm not coding, you can find me outside with my dog or running my wedding photography business. My first love and passion was photography at an early age. No matter the career changes I go through, it will always be an important aspect of my life.
